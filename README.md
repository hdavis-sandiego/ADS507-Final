# ADS507-Final

# Hello! Welcome to the MSADS 507 Final Project page for Team 4.

The research is analyzing data from February 2020 to February 2023 from the book store. 

For your convenience, we have combined all 13 original code files into a single sql file. 

The contributors to the project are: 

Claire Phibbs : https://github.com/cphibbs \
Halle Davis: https://github.com/hdavis-sandiego \
UE Wang: https://github.com/UE-Wang 

# Table of Contents:
### Dataset:

1. The initial SQL file that generated the data is located at:

https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_gravity 

2. Population of each countries:

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

3. Income of each countries:

# ? Data Source Link

SQL scripts:

# ? file link

Python ipybn file:

# ? ipybn file

### Generate the Database:

1. Use the #(Link to the sql data file) to run the whole script./
Using SQL, a total of 15 tables are added for the book store. Name the database as 'gravity books'. 
2. Using "Table Data Import Wizard" in the MySQL Workbench to import the population.csv file. 
3. Using "Table Data Import Wizard" in the MySQL Workbench to import the income.csv file. 
4. By this time, your gravity_books database should have a total of 17 tables.

### To improve readability and security, run the *Final.sql file to generate the VIEWs for this database.
